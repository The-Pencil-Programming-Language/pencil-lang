# Pencil-lang

> A high-level programming language designed to build applications that fully utilize contemporary hardware.

---

## Overview

Pencil-lang is a modern programming language that prioritizes developer productivity without compromising performance. Built from the ground up to harness the full potential of contemporary hardware, Pencil-lang combines clean syntax with powerful capabilities to create applications ranging from simple utilities to complex systems.

---

## Features

### General Purpose
Suitable for building everything from command-line utilities to operating systems and desktop applications.

### Simple Syntax
Concise, easy to learn, read, and write. Developer productivity and readability take precedence over verbose constructs.

### Safe & Stable
Memory safety, strong typing, and reliability with predictability at runtime ensure robust applications.

## Code Example

```pencil
name: string = "Pencil";
sentence: string = f"My name is {name}";
    
print(name);
```

*Clean, expressive, and intuitive â€“ that's the Pencil-lang way.*

---

## Goals

- **Clean Performance**: Expressive syntax without sacrificing performance
- **Developer Efficiency**: Reduce boilerplate while maintaining readability and expressiveness
- **Complete Toolchain**: Integrated compiler, package manager, and language server
- **Memory Safety**: Safe by default with low-level control when needed

---

## Documentation

Documentation is actively being developed. Coming soon:

- Language specification
- Compiler internals
- Standard library documentation
- Tutorials and guides

---

## Build Instructions

Pencil-lang is still in its infancy but ready for experimentation! To build from source:

```bash
# Navigate to the compiler directory
cd compiler

# Build the project
make
```
