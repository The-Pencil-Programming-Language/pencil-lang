Pencil-lang

A high-level programming language designed to build applications for users that fully utilize contemporary hardware. 


--- 

### Overview

Pencil-lang is a performance-oriented, general-purpose, safe, and easy-to-use programming language. Built with modern software and hardware in mind, Pencil-lang strives to enable developers to easily write low-level-enabled, efficient, and readable applications.

Driven by LLVM, Pencil-lang compiles down to highly optimized native code, making it an excellent solution for system-level programming, high-performance software, and contemporary software that needs to take full advantage of hardware capabilities.

### Features

General Purpose – Suitable to build everything ranging from command-line utilities to operating systems and desktop applications.

Simple Syntax – Concise, easy to learn, read, and write. Developer productivity and readability take precedence.

LLVM Integration – Close integration with LLVM allows NovaLang to generate efficient machine code and cross-platform compilation.

Safe & Stable – Memory safety, strong typing, and reliability and predictability at runtime.

### Code Example

fn main() {
    print("Hello, world!");
}

More code examples coming soon.


---
### Goals

Clean and expressive syntax without sacrificing performance

A standard toolchain consisting of a compiler, package manager, and language server

Great C/LLVM interop for system-level extension possibilities

Memory safety by default with low-level control where needed
